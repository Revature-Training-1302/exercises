## Asynchronous Coding Challenge

Today's coding challenge is asynchronous, meaning you can work on it whenever you're not in your 1-on-1. Please leave all of your java code in the same exercise repo that you've been using for the exercises. 

Tip: When creating your Java project in IntelliJ, you can create it within your exercises repo, thus eliminating the need to copy/paste it over later. 

The exercises are as follows:

1. Write a program to create an array of 10 integers and then reverse the array. 

2. Write a program to create an array of strings and then print out the array and strings backwards. 
    - Example, given {"Harry", "Ron", "Hermione"}, print out "enoimreH", "noR", "yrraH".

You can write the 2 exercises in one file or 2 different ones, as long as it easy for me to see where each one is.
