Check out this article and write a script that solves each of the 10 questions: https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/sql-code-challenges-for-beginners/. 

The questions have sample tables but don't give the SQL code to create them. You can either write the code yourself or try writing the query without testing it. 

Example for number 1, you would write 
```sql
create table table1(id integer, value integer);
insert into table1 values(1, -56);
insert into table1 values(2, 76);
insert into table1 values(3, -84);
insert into table1 values(4, 96);
insert into table1 values(5, -47);
```

For number 9, check out the distinct keyword: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_distinct.asp.

Write all your queries in a script and submit it to me on your Github exercise repo by Monday (8/22) at 10 EST.
