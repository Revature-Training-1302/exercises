## Project Two

- What feature/aspect of your project are you most proud of?
    - I'm proud of my team collaboration and dedication during the developmenet of the project. I'm also proud of our website UI design.
- What are some challenges you faced while working on the project?
    - The first challenge we faced during the project was in designing our database and relations. many-to-many relationship between shopping carts and books was challenging during the ER diagram design before comming up with the order_line relation.
    - Managing the code in github and resolving conflicts while merging different features was a new task for me and challenging.
- What would you work on if you had another week on project 2?
    - Deployment of the website.
    - Some additional feature as password reset, admin view, email notifications.
- What would you do differently if you could start the project over?
    - Take advantage of the custom queries of JPA.
    - Adapt Agile methodology through ensuring having a working version of the project in an early stage and enhance it later on.
    - Test the code more often.
- What do you wish you knew at the start of the project (either about the development process or the technologies used)?
    - Knowing Angular in advance would give us a better vision to how our front end would be designed later on, and by knowing all the functionalities that Angular offer would save us time in designing and progrmming the front-end.
    - Better understanding of Github flow.
- How can you apply these lessons to project 3?
    - Our shortcomings during this project were valuable and great experience that would be carried to the next projects. getting a better understanding of Spring and Angular frameworks through this project will be a valuable skills to use in the next project.
