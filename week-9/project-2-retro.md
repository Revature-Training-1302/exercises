# Project 2 Retrospect - Gavin Werner

### What feature/aspect of your project are you most proud of?

It's really a simple feature but I was most excited when I got the cookies to track the customer ID as they navigate all through the site. Something about that just felt so cool and made me feel proud.

### What are some challenges you faced while working on the project?

Some challenges I faced were a result of my lack of understanding of syntax in javaScript in general let alone typeScript. As I had to trouble shoot my features including login, cookies, searching for products, and creating a dropdown navigation menu, I really started to understand the syntax of functions in typeScript and I felt more confident in the project. So, in short, the biggest challenge for me was comprehending the syntax and following that logic to make sure I was passing in the right type of data in the right place.

### What would you work on if you had another week on project 2?

I would continue trying to troubleshoot our merge difficulty that arose at the end of the development period. When we did our final merge of our projects, the two-way binding ngModel was not working properly for any of our components and we were getting an error that would not allow the project to compile in the front end. I would spend more time looking in to this issue and resolving it because I truly believe that if we were able to merge the project entirely we would have a pretty awesome website.

### What would you do differently if you could start the project over?

I would focus only on the logic and the core and necessary functions of the project. I would do no extra styling until everything was working properly. For one, it didn't leave us with enough time at the end to troubleshoot serious logic issues. Furthermore, our styling was cool but it made it harder to follow the logic at times because it could be distracting, whereas if we just had the barebone elements displaying on our pages then I think it would be easier to focus on the logic.

### What do you wish you knew at the start of the project (either about the development process or the technologies used)?

I wish I had known that we should merge more frequently. I think I had known about this and I had heard it, but because I was still a little confused on what merging actually entails, I didn't understand how essential it is to merge a lot so that you don't get stuck with a mess at the end.

### How can you apply these lessons to project 3?

I will break my tasks and features down into the most basic components first and make sure that I have those working properly before moving on to extra styling and conditions. I will also merge frequently and make it very clear exactly what I added each time I merge.
