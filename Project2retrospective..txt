What feature/aspect of your project are you most proud of?
I am most proud of figuring out how to interate from an array inside of an array and displaying that on screen.

What are some challenges you faced while working on the project?
Figuring out how the relational database should be structured and uploading to AWS.

What would you work on if you had another week on project 2?
Creating a better user interface. uploading to AWS. more error catching.

What would you do differently if you could start the project over?
work on different databse relations. hopefully make one that isn't so hard to work with.

What do you wish you knew at the start of the project (either about the development process or the technologies used)?
I wish I knew how components in angular worked together better.

How can you apply these lessons to project 3?
I know the first thing I need to get down is how the entities must realte inorder to stream line queries. I know how the components interact with each other
Overall I know what I am weakest on and should work on first.
