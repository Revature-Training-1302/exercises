## Steps
1. First 30 minutes, one person interviews the other using questions from the actual client that they, the interviewee, are mapped to (or could be mapped to). If you've already interviewed, make sure you are asked questions from a different company. The questions will be posted in Teams
2. Take a 10-15 minutes break.
3. Swap roles and repeat step 2.
4. Everyone come back to the main room to share their thoughts.

Keep in mind these questions:
1. What makes a good answer?
2. What are some indicators that an answer could use some improvement?
3. How do you manage nerves during an interview?
4. What do you wish you were better at?
5. What did your partner do that you want to emulate in future interviews?
