## Please answer the following questions and push up to your branch. 
1. What feature/aspect of your project are you most proud of?
Spring is the hardest part for me in this training, so am proud that i was able to get my part done in the back-end

2. What are some challenges you faced while working on the project?
dealing with issues at thr front-end, and connecting the program to AWS

3. What would you work on if you had another week on project 2?
Changing the databace and conneting the program to aws

4. What would you do differently if you could start the project over?
We got the ERD wrong, so that will be the first change, then starting the AWS proccess as soon as possible.

5. What do you wish you knew at the start of the project (either about the development process or the technologies used)?
most of the aterials that was covered after the the project was announced, because it was very easy to fall behind trying to keep up with the materials and reflect everything in the project at the same time. Eventhougt we had a lot of time as self study in class, it was hard to understand and implement in short amount of time

6. How can you apply these lessons to project 3?
Evethough am expecting project 3 to be harder than project 2 in term of the requirement, the fact that no new materials will be introduced would enable me to be in better position dealing with it. Also i think now i understand Spring and Angular more than when i first introduced to these topics. Fitnally i will need to start  the AWS proccess as early as possiable, due to the fact that i may get some unexpected errors during the proccess.
